# SW1Project_Orderk
This project represents an online food delivery service, developed as a team project during the second year at the Faculty of Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence, Helwan University (FCAIH). As the team leader, my assigned responsibilities included defining requirements and design class and objects diagrams and gather the tasks for the documentation (Phase 1 ) and implementing the home page (Header,Footer), the About Us page, and the Admin Dashboard from the implementation task (Phase2).


**This project is designed to utilize PHP and MySQL. While we had the flexibility to choose any frontend template, we opted to employ the frontend template that we had previously designed in the preceding year.**

## Phase 1: Pre-Implementation Design

In Phase 1, our team concentrated on the pre-implementation design, dedicated to crafting essential diagrams and comprehensive documentation for the project. The key accomplishments during this phase include:

- **Requirements Definition:**
  - Thoroughly defined both functional and non-functional project requirements to establish a solid foundation for development.

- **Diagrams Design:**
  - Developed a suite of diagrams, encompassing Use Case, Activity, System Architecture, Database Design and ERD, Class, Object, and Sequence diagrams. These visual representations serve as crucial guides for the project's architecture and functionalities.

- **Project Documentation:**
  - Generated detailed and comprehensive project documentation, capturing the essence of the requirements and design decisions made during this phase.



### **My tasks**


1. **Defining Requirements:**
   - Led the analysis and definition of project requirements, ensuring clarity and alignment with the project's overall objectives.

2. **Class and Object Diagrams:**
   - Took a leading role in designing comprehensive class and object diagrams, providing a visual representation of the system's structure and relationships.

3. **Documentation Compilation:**
   - Gathered and organized tasks to create a detailed documentation package, ensuring that all relevant information was well-documented and easily accessible for the team.


## Phase 2: Implementation

Phase 2 marked the transition from design to implementation, where the team translated the defined requirements and design decisions into functional code. 
- **Coding and Development:**
  - Engaged in collaborative coding efforts to implement the designed features and functionalities according to the established requirements.

- **Documentation Update:**
  - Maintained comprehensive documentation, updating it to reflect any changes made during the implementation phase.
### **My tasks**
